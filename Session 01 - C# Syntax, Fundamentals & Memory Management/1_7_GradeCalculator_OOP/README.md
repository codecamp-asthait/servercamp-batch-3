
# WHAT IS OOP?

------------
Object-Oriented Programming is a programming paradigm that organizes 
code around "objects" rather than functions and logic.

## KEY CONCEPTS:

-------------
1. CLASS: A blueprint/template for creating objects
   - Think of it as a cookie cutter

2. OBJECT: An instance of a class
   - Think of it as the actual cookie

3. ENCAPSULATION: Bundling data and methods that work on that data
   - Keeps related things together

4. ABSTRACTION: Hiding complex implementation details
   - You don't need to know how a car engine works to drive it


## WHY DO WE NEED OOP?

-------------------

### ❌ PROCEDURAL PROBLEMS:

   - Data scattered across multiple variables/arrays
   - No clear relationship between data
   - Hard to maintain as code grows
   - No data protection
   - Functions need many parameters
   - Code duplication

### ✅ OOP SOLUTIONS:

   - Groups related data together
   - Clear structure and organization
   - Easier to maintain and extend
   - Data protection through encapsulation
   - Reusable code through inheritance
   - Real-world modeling

## Question

Did we achieve complete encapsulation?

Did we achieve data protection?

=> No. Though we have methods like ImproveGrade, we can still modify Grades directly.
