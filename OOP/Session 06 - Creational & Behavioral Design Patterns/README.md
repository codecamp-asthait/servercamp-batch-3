# Class 5 – Creational & Behavioral Design Patterns

## Why Do We Need Design Patterns?

Picture this: You're building a car. Do you invent the wheel from scratch? No! You use the wheel design that's been proven to work for centuries.

Design patterns are the same idea for code. They're proven solutions to common problems that developers face again and again. Instead of reinventing the wheel every time, we learn from those who came before us.

## The Three Types of Design Patterns

There are 23 classic design patterns divided into three categories:

- **Creational** – How to create objects
- **Structural** – How to organize classes and objects
- **Behavioral** – How objects communicate and behave

**But here's the truth:** You don't need all 23!
In most real-world projects, you'll use maybe **5-7 patterns regularly**. Some you'll never touch. Today, we'll focus on the **most practical ones** that you'll actually use in your career.

## Singleton - A Creational Design Pattern

Examples 1_1 to 1_4 demonstrate achieving singleton.

**Advanced Task**: Try Simulating race condition when thread-safety is not used in singleton by running parallel threads.
